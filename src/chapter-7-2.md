MBCT programs combine mindfulness practices with cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help individuals manage depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. MBCT programs can also be helpful for individuals who want to deepen their mindfulness practice and develop greater emotional regulation skills. Many mental health clinics and community centers offer MBCT programs.
